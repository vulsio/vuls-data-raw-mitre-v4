		"text": "Assigned",
		"date": "20041104"
	},
	"desc": "The addslashes function in PHP 4.3.9 does not properly escape a NULL (/0) character, which may allow remote attackers to read arbitrary files in PHP applications that contain a directory traversal vulnerability in require or include statements, but are otherwise protected by the magic_quotes_gpc mechanism.  NOTE: this issue was originally REJECTed by its CNA before publication, but that decision is in active dispute.  This candidate may change significantly in the future as a result of further discussion.",

			"text": "There is active disagreement regarding whether this satisfies the\ncriteria for inclusion in CVE, because the attack vectors require\nfunction parameters that are typically controlled only by the\napplication developer, not an external attacker.  This would mean that\nonly the PHP application owner could exploit it.\n\nSince the application developer presumably already has acccess\nto the underlying file system, directory traversal attacks provide no\nadditional access to the application owner.  Therefore, this candidate\nwould only be valid if there are cases in which the attacker can\ninject a null character into a string that is processed by addslashes.",
