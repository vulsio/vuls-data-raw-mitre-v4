  "desc": "An issue was discovered in IDM UltraEdit through 24.10.0.32. To exploit the vulnerability, on unpatched Windows systems, an attacker could include in the same directory as the affected executable a DLL using the name of a Windows DLL. This DLL must be preloaded by the executable (for example, \"ntmarta.dll\"). When the installer EXE is executed by the user, the DLL located in the EXE's current directory will be loaded instead of the Windows DLL, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the affected system.",
