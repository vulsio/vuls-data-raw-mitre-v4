  "desc": "A vulnerability in SMART-SSL Accelerator functionality for Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) 6.2.1, 6.2.1a, and 6.2.3a could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition where the WAN optimization could stop functioning while the process restarts. The vulnerability is due to a Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) alert being incorrectly handled when in a specific SSL/TLS connection state. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a SMART-SSL connection through the targeted device. The attacker would then send a crafted stream of SSL/TLS traffic. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition where WAN optimization could stop processing traffic for a short period of time. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb71133.",
