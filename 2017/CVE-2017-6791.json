  "desc": "A vulnerability in the Trust Verification Service (TVS) of Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating incomplete traffic streams. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny access to the TVS for an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition, until an administrator restarts the service. Known Affected Releases 10.0(1.10000.24) 10.5(2.10000.5) 11.0(1.10000.10) 9.1(2.10000.28). Cisco Bug IDs: CSCux21905.",
