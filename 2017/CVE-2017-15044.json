  "desc": "The default installation of DocuWare Fulltext Search server through 6.11 allows remote users to connect to and download searchable text from the embedded Solr service, bypassing DocuWare's access control features of the DocuWare user interfaces and API. An attacker can also gain privileges by modifying text. The default installation is unsafe because the server listens on the network interface, not the localhost interface.",
