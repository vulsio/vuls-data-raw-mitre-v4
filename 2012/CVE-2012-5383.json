	"desc": "** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation functionality in Oracle MySQL 5.5.28, when installed in the top-level C:\\ directory, might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the \"C:\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.5\\bin\" directory, which may be added to the PATH system environment variable by an administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the \"IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules\" system service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview. NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the unsafe PATH is established only by a separate administrative action that is not a default part of the MySQL installation.",
