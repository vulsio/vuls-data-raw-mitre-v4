All describe slightly different overflows\nthat, perhaps, should be merged according to CD:SF-LOC.\nIt depends on which versions are affected, which would require\nsome vendor acknowledgement or consultation.\n\nA vague changelog for version 3.1 at\nhttp://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=75333 says\n\"security fixes\" but it's not clear *which* security fixes\nwere made.\n\nThe description for CVE-2000-0641 is slightly incorrect.  The\nexploit is clearly due to a large number of headers, not\narguments to the GET request itself.  So, CVE-2000-0641\nclearly overlaps with CVE-2001-0433.\n\nThe exploit for CVE-2001-0433 also doesn't really have\nanything to do with a \"cgi-test.pl\" program (which isn't in\nthe distribution).  The discloser simply used that as an\nexample program of a long request.",
