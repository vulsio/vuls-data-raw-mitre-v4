However, swf_clear.html doesn't\nmention fscommand (\"exec\") AT ALL, which casts doubt or at\nleast uncertainty as to my conclusions.\n\nswf_clear.html links back to standalone_update.htm, so at\nleast the references are circular.\n\nAt least it's pretty clear that this issue is different from\nCVE-2002-0476.\n\nEmail inquiry sent to Macromedia on June 13, 2002.",
