			"text": "LPRng does not contain anything called runlpr, and in fact if you\nlook at the packages SuSE say that they ship as part of the erratum they\ndon't even provide updated LPRng packages.  However they do ship lprfilter\npackages and looking inside them I find that they are what contain this \nrunlpr program:\n\nhttp://at.rpmfind.net/opsys/linux/RPM/suse.com/i386/update/8.0/ap1/lpdfilter-0.42-155.i386.html\n\nThis states that lpdfilter is a collection of scripts written by SuSE, and\nthe changelog even highlights this is where the security fix was made.\nTherefore I believe that the CVE reference and all the descriptions of\nthis vulnerability, which are based on a bad advisory description from\nSuSE, are also wrong, it should be:\n\n\"runlpr from the SuSE lpdfilter package allows the local lp user to gain\nroot privileges via certain command line arguments.\"",
