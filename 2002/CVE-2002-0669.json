      "text": "I don't believe that a configuration option by the administrator is a\nvulnerability.  The fact that the administrator can require authentication\nof users attempting to use the service, without notifying users that\nare NOT using authentication is not a vulnerability.  For example, I\ncould configure sshd to allow only certain hosts to connect, by means of\na key, and if someone else tried to connect that is not authorized, it\nwould disallow it.  Similarly, the administrator could require authentication\nand only notify those users allowed to connect of the necessary authentication\ncredentials to preclude un-authorized use of the system.  The only way I would\nsee this as a vulnerability was if the change was able to be made without\nthe proper credentials through some fault in the program, or if there was no way to enable authentication on\nany client trying to connect which would render the system unusable to everyone\n(but that would still not really be a vulnerability as much as a \"stupid\nfeature\")\nThe ability to make this change afer gaining administrator priveleges by means\nof another vulnerability does not make this a vulnerability.  I would classify\nthis as a configuration setting that can severly restrict access, at the discretion\nof the administrator.",
