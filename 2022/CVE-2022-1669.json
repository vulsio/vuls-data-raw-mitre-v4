  "desc": "A buffer overflow vulnerability has been detected in the firewall function of the device management web portal. The device runs a CGI binary (index.cgi) to offer a management web application. Once authenticated with valid credentials in this web portal, a potential attacker could submit any \"Address\" value and it would be copied to a second variable with a \"strcpy\" vulnerable function without checking its length. Because of this, it is possible to send a long address value to overflow the process stack, controlling the function return address.",
