  "desc": "Nextcloud Talk is a video and audio conferencing app for Nextcloud. Prior to versions 12.2.7, 13.0.7, and 14.0.3, password protected conversations are susceptible to brute force attacks if the attacker has the link/conversation token. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application is upgraded to 12.2.7, 13.0.7 or 14.0.3. There are currently no known workarounds available apart from not having password protected conversations.",
