By prematurely deleting objects associated with pages, a specially-crafted PDF document can trigger the reuse of previously freed memory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially-crafted, malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.",
