	"desc": "Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible for a page controlled by an attacker to load the website within an iframe. This will enable a clickjacking attack, in which the attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. A workaround is available. Every response from app should have an X-Frame-Options header set to: ``sameorigin``. To achieve that, add a new `subscriber` in the app.",
