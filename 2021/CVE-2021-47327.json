	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: iommu/arm-smmu: Fix arm_smmu_device refcount leak when arm_smmu_rpm_get fails arm_smmu_rpm_get() invokes pm_runtime_get_sync(), which increases the refcount of the \"smmu\" even though the return value is less than 0. The reference counting issue happens in some error handling paths of arm_smmu_rpm_get() in its caller functions. When arm_smmu_rpm_get() fails, the caller functions forget to decrease the refcount of \"smmu\" increased by arm_smmu_rpm_get(), causing a refcount leak. Fix this issue by calling pm_runtime_resume_and_get() instead of pm_runtime_get_sync() in arm_smmu_rpm_get(), which can keep the refcount balanced in case of failure.",
