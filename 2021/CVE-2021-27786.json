	"desc": "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) enables browsers to perform cross domain requests in a controlled manner. This request has an Origin header that identifies the domain that is making the initial request and defines the protocol between a browser and server to see if the request is allowed. An attacker can take advantage of this and possibly carry out privileged actions and access sensitive information when the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is enabled.",
