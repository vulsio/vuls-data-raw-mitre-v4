	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: stmmac: Disable Tx queues when reconfiguring the interface The Tx queues were not disabled in situations where the driver needed to stop the interface to apply a new configuration. This could result in a kernel panic when doing any of the 3 following actions: * reconfiguring the number of queues (ethtool -L) * reconfiguring the size of the ring buffers (ethtool -G) * installing/removing an XDP program (ip l set dev ethX xdp) Prevent the panic by making sure netif_tx_disable is called when stopping an interface. Without this patch, the following kernel panic can be observed when doing any of the actions above: Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff80001238d040 [....] Call trace: dwmac4_set_addr+0x8/0x10 dev_hard_start_xmit+0xe4/0x1ac sch_direct_xmit+0xe8/0x39c __dev_queue_xmit+0x3ec/0xaf0 dev_queue_xmit+0x14/0x20 [...] [ end trace 0000000000000002 ]---",
