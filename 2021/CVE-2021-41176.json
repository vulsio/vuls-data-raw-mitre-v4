	"desc": "Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with PHP 7, React, and Go. In affected versions of Pterodactyl a malicious user can trigger a user logout if a signed in user visits a malicious website that makes a request to the Panel's sign-out endpoint. This requires a targeted attack against a specific Panel instance, and serves only to sign a user out. **No user details are leaked, nor is any user data affected, this is simply an annoyance at worst.** This is fixed in version 1.6.3.",
