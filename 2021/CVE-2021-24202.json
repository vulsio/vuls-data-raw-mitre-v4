Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified ‘save_builder’ request with this parameter set to ‘script’ and combined with a ‘title’ parameter containing JavaScript, which will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.",
