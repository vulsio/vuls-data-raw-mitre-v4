  "desc": "Sulu is an open-source PHP content management system based on the Symfony framework. In affected versions an attacker can read arbitrary local files via a PHP file include. In a default configuration this also leads to remote code execution. The problem is patched with the Versions 1.6.44, 2.2.18, 2.3.8, 2.4.0. For users unable to upgrade overwrite the service `sulu_route.generator.expression_token_provider` and wrap the translator before passing it to the expression language.",
