	"desc": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user. These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker would need valid administrative credentials.",
