	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: sched: fix memory leak in tcindex_partial_destroy_work Syzbot reported memory leak in tcindex_set_parms(). The problem was in non-freed perfect hash in tcindex_partial_destroy_work(). In tcindex_set_parms() new tcindex_data is allocated and some fields from old one are copied to new one, but not the perfect hash. Since tcindex_partial_destroy_work() is the destroy function for old tcindex_data, we need to free perfect hash to avoid memory leak.",
