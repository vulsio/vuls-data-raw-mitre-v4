	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mptcp: fix sk_forward_memory corruption on retransmission MPTCP sk_forward_memory handling is a bit special, as such field is protected by the msk socket spin_lock, instead of the plain socket lock. Currently we have a code path updating such field without handling the relevant lock: __mptcp_retrans() -> __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup() Several helpers in __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup() will update sk_forward_alloc, possibly causing such field corruption, as reported by Matthieu. Address the issue providing and using a new variant of blamed function which explicitly acquires the msk spin lock.",
