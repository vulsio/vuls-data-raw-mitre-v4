	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ixgbe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test The ixgbe driver currently generates a NULL pointer dereference when performing the ethtool loopback test. This is due to the fact that there isn't a q_vector associated with the test ring when it is setup as interrupts are not normally added to the test rings. To address this I have added code that will check for a q_vector before returning a napi_id value. If a q_vector is not present it will return a value of 0.",
