	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netfilter: nf_tables: Fix dereference of null pointer flow In the case where chain->flags & NFT_CHAIN_HW_OFFLOAD is false then nft_flow_rule_create is not called and flow is NULL. The subsequent error handling execution via label err_destroy_flow_rule will lead to a null pointer dereference on flow when calling nft_flow_rule_destroy. Since the error path to err_destroy_flow_rule has to cater for null and non-null flows, only call nft_flow_rule_destroy if flow is non-null to fix this issue. Addresses-Coverity: (\"Explicity null dereference\")",
