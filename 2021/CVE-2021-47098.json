	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer overflow/underflow in hysteresis calculations Commit b50aa49638c7 (\"hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer underflows of temperature calculations\") addressed a number of underflow situations when writing temperature limits. However, it missed one situation, seen when an attempt is made to set the hysteresis value to MAX_LONG and the critical temperature limit is negative. Use clamp_val() when setting the hysteresis temperature to ensure that the provided value can never overflow or underflow.",
