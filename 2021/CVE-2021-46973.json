	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: qrtr: Avoid potential use after free in MHI send It is possible that the MHI ul_callback will be invoked immediately following the queueing of the skb for transmission, leading to the callback decrementing the refcount of the associated sk and freeing the skb. As such the dereference of skb and the increment of the sk refcount must happen before the skb is queued, to avoid the skb to be used after free and potentially the sk to drop its last refcount..",
