	"desc": "In version 6.5 of Microchip MiWi software and all previous versions including legacy products, there is a possibility of frame counters being validated/updated prior to the message authentication. With this vulnerability in place, an attacker may increment the incoming frame counter values by injecting messages with a sufficiently large frame counter value and invalid payload. This results in denial of service/valid packets in the network. There is also a possibility of a replay attack in the stack.",
