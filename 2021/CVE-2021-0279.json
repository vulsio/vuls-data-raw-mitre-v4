The messaging services of RabbitMQ are used when coordinating operations and status information among Contrail services. An attacker with access to an administrative service for RabbitMQ (e.g. GUI), can use these hardcoded credentials to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) or have access to unspecified sensitive system information. This issue affects the Juniper Networks Contrail Cloud releases on versions prior to 13.6.0.",
