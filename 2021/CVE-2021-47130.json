	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nvmet: fix freeing unallocated p2pmem In case p2p device was found but the p2p pool is empty, the nvme target is still trying to free the sgl from the p2p pool instead of the regular sgl pool and causing a crash (BUG() is called). Instead, assign the p2p_dev for the request only if it was allocated from p2p pool.
