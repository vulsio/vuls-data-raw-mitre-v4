	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: spi: Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on SPI buses Currently we have a global spi_add_lock which we take when adding new devices so that we can check that we're not trying to reuse a chip select that's already controlled. This means that if the SPI device is itself a SPI controller and triggers the instantiation of further SPI devices we trigger a deadlock as we try to register and instantiate those devices while in the process of doing so for the parent controller and hence already holding the global spi_add_lock. Since we only care about concurrency within a single SPI bus move the lock to be per controller, avoiding the deadlock. This can be easily triggered in the case of spi-mux.",
