A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an integer overflow when the library encounters an atom using the “trun” FOURCC code due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.",
