	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: io_uring: ensure task_work gets run as part of cancelations If we successfully cancel a work item but that work item needs to be processed through task_work, then we can be sleeping uninterruptibly in io_uring_cancel_generic() and never process it. Hence we don't make forward progress and we end up with an uninterruptible sleep warning. While in there, correct a comment that should be IFF, not IIF.",
