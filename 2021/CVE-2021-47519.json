	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: can: m_can: m_can_read_fifo: fix memory leak in error branch In m_can_read_fifo(), if the second call to m_can_fifo_read() fails, the function jump to the out_fail label and returns without calling m_can_receive_skb(). This means that the skb previously allocated by alloc_can_skb() is not freed. In other terms, this is a memory leak. This patch adds a goto label to destroy the skb if an error occurs. Issue was found with GCC -fanalyzer, please follow the link below for details.",
