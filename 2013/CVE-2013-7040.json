		"text": "Assigned",

	},
	"desc": "Python 2.7 before 3.4 only uses the last eight bits of the prefix to randomize hash values, which causes it to compute hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably and makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-1150.",
