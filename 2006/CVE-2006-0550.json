	"desc": "Buffer overflow in an unspecified Oracle Client utility might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.  NOTE: due to the lack of relevant details from the Oracle advisory, a separate CVE is being created since it cannot be conclusively proven that this issue has been addressed by Oracle.  It is possible that this is the same issue as Oracle Vuln# DBC02 from the January 2006 CPU, in which case this would be a duplicate of CVE-2006-0283.  However, there are enough inconsistencies that the mapping can not be made authoritatively.",
