As currently worded, this candidate seems as if an arbitrary\nhost \nis vulnerable because it is capable of running an arbitrary program\nor\nfunction (in this case, ping/ICMP echo). There are many\nprograms/functions that \n'shouldn't' be on a computer, from a security admin's perspective.\nEven if this\nwere a vulnerability, it would be impacted by CD-HIGHCARD.",

      "text": "Every ICMP message type presents a vulnerability or an\nexposure, if access is not controlled.  By that I mean not only those\nin RFC 792, but also those in RFC 1256, 950, and more.  I think that\nthe description should be changed to \"ICMP messages are acted upon\nwithout any access control\".  ICMP is an error and debugging protocol.\nWe complain about vendors leaving testing backdoors in their programs.\nICMP is the equivalent for TCP/IP.  ICMP should be in the dog house,\nunless you are trying to troubleshoot something.  MTU discovery is\njust a performance tweak -- it's not necessary.  I don't know of any\nICMP message type that is necessary if the network is functional.\nLimited logging of ICMP messages could be useful, but acting upon them\nand allowing the modification of routing tables, the behavior of the\nTCP/IP stack, etc... without any form of authentication is just crazy.",
