There are a couple\nproblems with the references and descriptions of CVE-1999-1050\nand CVE-1999-1051.  I'm interpreting the underlying nature\nof the problem(s) a little differently than others are.\nSome of it may be due to differing definitions or thoughts\nabout what \"directory traversal vulnerabilities\" are.",
