			"text": "The pkg* programs pkgtrans, pkginfo, pkgcat, pkginstall, and pkgparam\ncan be used to mount etc/shadow printing attacks as a result of the\n\"dacread\" permission (cf. /etc/security/tcb/privs). The procedural\ndifferences between the individual exploits for each of these utilities\nare therefore inconsequential. CVE-1999-0988 should be merged with\nCVE-1999-0828. From the standpoint of maintaining consistency of the\nlevel of abstraction used in CVE, the co-existence of CANS\n1999-0988/1999-0828 present two choices: either merge 0988 with 0828, or\nsplit 0828 into 4 distinct candidates, keeping 0988 intact. Due to the\nvery small differences (in principle) between the exploits subsumed by\n0828 and 0988 and the shared dacread permissions of the pkg* suite, I\nsuggest a merge. Below is a summary of the data upon which my decision\nwas based.\nutility         exploit\n--------      ---------------------------------- ",

While there are few procedural\ndifferences, one could view \"assignment of an improper\npermission\" as a \"class\" of problems along the lines of\nbuffer overflows and the like.  Just like some programs\nwere fine until they got turned into CGI scripts, this\ncould be an emerging pattern which should be given\nconsideration.
