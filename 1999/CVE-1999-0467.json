			"text": "CVE-1999-0287 is probably a duplicate of CVE-1999-0467.  In\nNTBUGTRAQ:19990409 Webcom's CGI Guestbook for Win32 web servers\nMnemonix says that he had previously reported on a similar\nproblem.  Let's refer to the NTBugtraq posting as\nCVE-1999-0467.  We will refer to the \"previous report\" as\nCVE-1999-0287, which can be found at:\nhttp://oliver.efri.hr/~crv/security/bugs/NT/httpd41.html\n\n0287 describes an exploit via the \"template\" hidden variable.\nThe exploit describes manually editing the HTML form to\nchange the filename to read from the template variable.\n\nThe exploit as described in 0467 encodes the template variable\ndirectly into the URL.  However, hidden variables are also\nencoded into the URL, which would have looked the same to\nthe web server regardless of the exploit.  Therefore 0287\nand 0467 are the same.",

CD:SF-EXEC needs to be accepted by the Editorial\nBoard before this candidate can be converted into a CVE\nentry.  When finalized, CD:SF-EXEC will decide whether\nthis candidate should be split or not.",
