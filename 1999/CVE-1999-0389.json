CVE-1999-0389\nhas January 1999 dates associated with it, while CVE-1999-0798\nwas reported in late December.\n\nAlso, is this the same line of code as CVE-1999-0914?  Both are in\nthe netstd package, it could look like a library problem.\n\nHowever, deep in the changelog in the\nnetstd_3.07-7slink.3.diff on Debian, Herbert Xu includes\nthe following entry:\n\n+netstd (3.07-7slink.1) frozen; urgency=high\n+\n+  * bootpd:     Applied patch from Redhat as well as a fix for the overflow in\n+                report() (fixes #30675).\n+  * netkit-ftp: Applied patch from RedHat that fixes some obscure overflow\n+                bugs.\n+\n+ -- Herbert Xu <herbert@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Dec 1998 14:36:48 +1100\n\nThis tells me that two separate bugs are involved.\n\nNote that Red Hat posted *some* fix for *some* bootp problem\nin June 1998.
