You don't\nwant the users to have access to your programs or log files that could\nbe stored there!\n\n...\n\nIf you can view or download these files from the browser, someone\nelse can too\"\n\nSo is this a configuration problem?  See the configuration file at\nhttp://www.quikstore.com/help/pages/Configuration/configparametersfull.htm\nThe [DIRECTORY_PATHS] section identifies pathnames and describes how\npathnames are constructed.  It clearly uses relative pathnames,\nso all data is underneath the base directory!!\n\nIf we call this a configuration problem, then maybe this (and\nall other \"CGI-data-in-web-tree\" configuration problems) should\nbe combined.",
