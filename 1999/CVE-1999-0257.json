Also see comments on CVE-1999-0001.\n\nSee: CVE-1999-0015, CVE-1999-0104, CVE-1999-0257, CVE-1999-0258\n\nIs CVE-1999-0001 the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related\nto nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in\nBUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release\nThe patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.\nThe patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.  So, \nCVE-1999-0001 is different from CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052.\nThe FreeBSD patch for CVE-1999-0052 is in line 750.\nSo, CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052 may be the same, though\nCVE-1999-0052 should be RECAST since this bug affects Linux\nand other OSes besides FreeBSD.\n\nAlso see BUGTRAQ:19990909 CISCO and nestea.\n\nFinally, note that there is no fundamental difference between\nnestea and nestea2/nestea-v2; they are different ports that\nexploit the same problem.\n\nThe original nestea advisory is at\nhttp://www.technotronic.com/rhino9/advisories/06.htm\nbut notice that the suggested fix is in line 375 of\nip_fragment.c, not ip_input.c.",
