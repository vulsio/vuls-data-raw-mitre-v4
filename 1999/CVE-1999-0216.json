Any program making the same (reasonnable)\nassumption is vulnerable, i.e., implements the same vulnerability:\n\"Assumption that TCP-three-way handshake is complete after calling Linux\nkernel function accept(), which returns socket after getting SYN.   Result\nis process death by SIGPIPE\"\nMoreover, whether it results in DOS (to third parties) depends on the\nprocess that made the assumption.\nI think that the present entry should be split, one entry for every\napplication that implements the vulnerability (really describing threat\ninstances, which is what other people think about when we talk about\nvulnerabilities), and one entry for the Linux kernel that allows the\nvulnerability to happen.",
