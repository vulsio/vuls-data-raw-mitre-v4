			"text": "Dan Bernstein, author of Qmail, says that this is not a\nvulnerability in qmail because Unix has built-in resource\nlimits that can restrict the size of a qmail process; other\nlimits can be specified by the administrator.  See\nhttp://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html\n\nSignificant discussion of this issue took place on the qmail\nlist.  The fundamental question appears to be whether \napplication software should set its own limits, or rely\non limits set by the parent operating system (in this case,\nUNIX).  Also, some people said that the only problem was that\nthe suggested configuration was not well documented, but this\nwas refuted by others.\n\nSee the following threads at\nhttp://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/1997/06/threads.html\n\"Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)\"\n\"qmail-dos-2.c, another denial of service\"\n\"[PATCH] denial of service\"\n\"just another qmail denial-of-service\"\n\"the UNIX way\"\n\"Time for a reality check\"\n\nAlso see Bugtraq threads on a different vulnerability that\nis related to this topic:\nBUGTRAQ:19990903 Web servers / possible DOS Attack / mime header flooding\nhttp://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/1998_3/0742.html",

The bugtraq\nposting referenced by this entry refers explicitly to the prior\nposting for 0144, and states that the same effect could be\naccomplished by a perl exploit, which was then attached.",
