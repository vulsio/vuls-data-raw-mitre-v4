There is evidence that some\nof these .cfm scripts have an \"include\" file, and if so, \nthen CD:SF-LOC says that we shouldn't make separate entries\nfor each of these scripts.  On the other hand, the initial\nL0pht discovery didn't include all 3 of these scripts, and\nas far as I can tell, Allaire had patched the first problem\nbefore the others were discovered.  So, CD:DISCOVERY-DATE\nmay argue that we should split these because the problems\nwere discovered and patched at different times.\n\nIn any case, this candidate can not be accepted until the\nEditorial Board has accepted the CD:SF-EXEC, CD:SF-LOC,\nand CD:DISCOVERY-DATE content decisions.",
