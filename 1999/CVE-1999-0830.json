SSE050b\n(ftp://ftp.sco.com/SSE/security_bulletins/SB-99.26b) fixes a buffer overflow\nin xsco on OpenServer (the vendor message Steve refers to) but not the\nUnixWare vulnerability reported on Bugtraq and in BID824. Anyone more\nfamilar with SCO shed some light on this? Are they the same codebase so fix\nwould be same?  From the SCO site it seems the UnixWare and OpenSever\nproducts are similar but have differences.",
