The appropriate (natural) level of\nabstraction is therefore without specifying that it is for UNIX.\nChange the description to \"An account has a guessable password other\nthan default, null, blank.\"  This should satisfy Andre's objection.\n\nThis Candidate should be merged with any candidate relating to\naccount password technology where \"Unix\" in the original description\ncan be replaced by something else.",
