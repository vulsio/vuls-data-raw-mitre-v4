In addition, the date on\nthe advisory is one day earlier than that of the Bugtraq post, though\nthat could be a difference in time zones. It seems plausible that the\nproblem had already been patched (the researcher did say \"There *was*\n[a] race condition\") so maybe SGI released this advisory after the\nproblem was publicized.\n\nADDREF BID:330\nURL:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/330\n\nNote: this is a dupe of CVE-1999-1410, but CVE-1999-1410 will\nbe rejected in favor of CVE-1999-1286.",
