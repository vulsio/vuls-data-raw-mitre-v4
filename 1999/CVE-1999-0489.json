The Untrusted Scripted paste\nvulnerability was originally addressed in MS98-015 and it is in the file\nupload intrinsic control in which an attacker can paste the name of a file\non the target's drive in the control and a form submission would then send\nthat file from the attacked machine to the remote web site.  This one has\nnothing to do with the clipboard.  What the advisory mentioned here,\nMS99-012, does is replace the MSHTML parsing engine which is supposed to fix\nthe original Untrusted Scripted Paste issue and a variant, as well as the\ntwo Cross-Frame variants and a privacy issue in IMG SRC.  \nThe vulnerability that allowed reading of a user's clipboard is the Forms\n2.0 Active X control vulnerability discussed in MS99-01",
