			"text": "Agreed, this is the wrong BID.  SecurityFocus has assigned\nBID:643 to CVE-1999-1570, but there's a bit of an\ninconsistency.  BID:643 alludes to Bugtraq posts in 1999\nfrom Brock Tellier, mentioning overflows in sar via BOTH the\n-o and -f parameters.  However, they also link this issue to\nSCO advisory 99.17, although the advisory itself is too vague\nto *really* know what vulns they fixed.  And now the link\nto a potentially more detailed document (sse037.ltr)\nis broken.  So we don't have any independent reason for\nknowing whether SCO 99.17 (a) addresses any \"sar\"\nvulnerabilities, and (b) even if it does, whether it addresses\n*both* the -o and -f arguments originally claimed by Tellier.\nFinally, it seems rather curious that CSSA-2002-SCO.17\ntalks about a -o overflow but does not mention -f.\nSounds like an email to the security people at SCO\nis in order...\n\nOK.  Having consulted with SCO (who responded quickly), I\nlooked even further into this issue.  There is now sufficient\nevidence that the -f overflow was fixed in 1999.  This\nmeans that a separate candidate should be created (by\nCD:SF-LOC), so the -f overflow is now covered by\nCVE-1999-1571.\n\nNeed to DELREF BID:4089",
