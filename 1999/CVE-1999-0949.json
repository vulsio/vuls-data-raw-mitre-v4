If it's the same generic option parsing\nroutine used by both programs, then CD:SF-CODEBASE says to\nmerge them.  But if it's not, then CD:SF-LOC and CD:SF-EXEC\nsays to split them.  However, this is a prime example of\nhow SF-EXEC might be modified - uum and canuum are clearly\npart of the same package, so in the absence of clear\ninformation, maybe we should merge them.\n\nAlso review BID:758 and BID:757 - may need to change the BID\nhere.",
