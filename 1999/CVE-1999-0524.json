It's a more\nprecise and correct language.  I believe that this is a valid CVE\nentry (it's a common source of vulnerabilities or exposures) even\nthough I see that the inferred action was \"reject\".  Knowing the time\nof a host also allows attacks against random number generators that\nare seeded with the current time.  I want to push to have it accepted.",
