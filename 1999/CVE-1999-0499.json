The system can be configured not to do\nthis, and one may argue that SNMP itself is an insecure configuration.\nFurthermore, the share information isn't published via registry keys -\nthe description could refer to more than one actual issue. SNMP is meant\nto allow people to obtain information about systems. I'm willing to\ndiscuss this with the rest of the board.",
