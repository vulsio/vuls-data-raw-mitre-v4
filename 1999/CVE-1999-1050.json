      "text": "Abstraction and definition issue: CD:SF-LOC suggests combining\nissues of the same type.  Some people refer to \"directory\ntraversal\" and just mean .. problems; but there are other\nissues (specifying an absolute pathname, using C: drive\nletters, doing encodings) that, to my way of thinking, are\n\"different.\"  Perhaps this should be split.\n\nMy brain hurts too much right now.  There are a couple\nproblems with the references and descriptions of CVE-1999-1050\nand CVE-1999-1051.  I'm interpreting the underlying nature\nof the problem(s) a little differently than others are.\nSome of it may be due to differing definitions or thoughts\nabout what \"directory traversal vulnerabilities\" are.",
