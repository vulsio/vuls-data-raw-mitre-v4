To remain consistent with the\nother, maybe it should specify \"...settings for passwords\" I think\nmost people would agree that passwords should be at least 8\ncharacters; contain letters (upper and lowercase), numbers and at\nleast one non-alphanumeric; should only be good a limited time 30-90\ndays; and should not contain character combinations from user's prior\n2 or 3 passwords.\nSuggested rewrite - \nA Windows NT account policy does not enforce reasonable minimum\nsecurity-critical settings for passwords, e.g. passwords of sufficient\nlength, periodic required password changes, or new password uniqueness",
