			"text": "It is not entirely clear whether the simple fact that an alias\npipes into a program should be considered a vulnerability.  It\nall depends on the behavior of that particular program.  This\nis one of a number of configuration-related issues from the\n\"draft\" CVE that came from vulnerability scanners.  In\ngeneral, when we get to general configuration and \"policy,\"\nit becomes more difficult to use the current CVE model to\nrepresent them.  So at the very least, this candidate (and\nsimilar ones) should be given close consideration and\ndiscussion before being added to the official CVE list.\n\nBecause this candidate is related to general configuration\nissues, and we have not completely determined how to handle\nsuch issues in CVE, this candidate cannot be promoted to an\nofficial CVE entry until such issues are resolved.",
