      "text": "The discloser does not provide enough details to fully\nunderstand what the problem is.  This makes it difficult\nbecause if Maximizer has a concept of \"users\" and it is\ndesigned to allow any user to modify any other user's data,\nthen this would not be a vulnerability or exposure, unless\nthat \"cross-user\" capability could be used to violate system\nintegrity, data confidentiality, or the like.  There are some\nfeatures of Maximizer 6.0 that, if abused, could allow someone\nto do some bad things.  For example, an attacker could modify\nthe email addresses for contacts to redirect sales to\nlocations besides the customer.  There's also a capability of\nassigning priorities and alarms, which could be susceptible to\nan \"inconvenience attack\" at the very least, as well as\ntie-ins to e-commerce capabilities.\n\nThe critical question becomes: \"how is this data shared\" in\nthe first place?  If it's through a network share or other\ndistribution method besides transferring the complete database\nbetween sites, then this may be accessible to any attacker who\ncan mimic a Maximizer client (if there is such a thing as a\nclient), and this could be a vulnerability or exposure\naccording to the CVE definition.\n\nHowever, since the Maximizer functionality is unknown to me\nand not readily apparent from product documentation, it's hard\nto know what to do about this one.",
