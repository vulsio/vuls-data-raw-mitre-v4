			"text": "This should be split into three separate problems based on\nthe SNI advisory.  But there's newer information to further\ncomplicate things.\n\nWhat do we do about this one?  in 1997 or so, SNI did an\nadvisory on this problem.  In early 2000, it was still\ndiscovered to be present in some Linux systems.  So an \nSF-DISCOVERY content decision might say that this is a\nlong enough time between the two, so this should be recorded\nseparately.  But they're the same codebase... so if we keep\nthem in the same entry, how do we make sure that this entry\nreflects that some new information has been discovered?\n\nThe use of dot notation may help in this regard, to use one\ndot for the original problem as discovered in 1997, and\nanother dot for the resurgence of the problem in 2000.",
