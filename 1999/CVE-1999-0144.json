      "text": "Dan Bernstein, author of Qmail, says that this is not a\nvulnerability in qmail because Unix has built-in resource\nlimits that can restrict the size of a qmail process; other\nlimits can be specified by the administrator.  See\nhttp://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html\n\nSignificant discussion of this issue took place on the qmail\nlist.  The fundamental question appears to be whether \napplication software should set its own limits, or rely\non limits set by the parent operating system (in this case,\nUNIX).  Also, some people said that the only problem was that\nthe suggested configuration was not well documented, but this\nwas refuted by others.\n\nSee the following threads at\nhttp://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/1997/06/threads.html\n\"Denial of service (qmail-smtpd)\"\n\"qmail-dos-2.c, another denial of service\"\n\"[PATCH] denial of service\"\n\"just another qmail denial-of-service\"\n\"the UNIX way\"\n\"Time for a reality check\"\n\nAlso see Bugtraq threads on a different vulnerability that\nis related to this topic:\nBUGTRAQ:19990903 Web servers / possible DOS Attack / mime header flooding\nhttp://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/1998_3/0742.html",

      "text": "http://cr.yp.to/qmail/venema.html\nBerstein rejects this as a vulnerability, claiming this is a slander campaign by Wietse Venema.\nHis page states this is not a qmail problem, rather it is a UNIX problem\nthat many apps can consume all available memory, and that the administrator\nis responsible to set limits in the OS, rather than expect applications to\nindividually prevent memory exhaustion.  CAN 1999-0250 does appear to\nbe a duplicate of this entry, based on the research I have done so far.\nThere were two different bugtraq postings, but the second one references\nthe first, stating that the new exploit uses perl instead of shell scripting\nto accomplish the same attack/exploit.",
