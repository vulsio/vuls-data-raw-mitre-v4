There is an\nearlier, similar setuid vulnerability in the CA-93.18, CIAC G-02 advisories\nfor the SunOS 4.1.x/Solbourne and OpenWindow 3.0.  In fact, there may be the\nsame as the HP patches are 100448-02 for the 93 loadmodule/modload\nvulnerability and 100448-03 for the 95 loadmodule vulnerability which\nnormally indicated a patch update.  Looks like the original patch either\ndidn't completely fix the problem or it resurfaced in X11 NeWS.  Can't tell\nmuch beyond that and this is my opinion only as have no way to check it.  \nWhich one is this CVE referencing?  I accept both.",
