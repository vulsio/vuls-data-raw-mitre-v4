	"desc": "In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ), an attacker might obtain OAuth2 client secrets from the vault. In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, we have identified a security vulnerability in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) regarding the OAuth2-protected data sink feature. When using a custom, OAuth2-protected data sink, the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically, the consumer-provided clientSecretKey, which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault, is resolved in the context of the provider's vault, not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl, also consumer-controlled, as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL. This feature is now disabled entirely, because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.",
