	"desc": "LedgerSMB is a free web-based double-entry accounting system. When a LedgerSMB database administrator has an active session in /setup.pl, an attacker can trick the admin into clicking on a link which automatically submits a request to setup.pl without the admin's consent. This request can be used to create a new user account with full application (/login.pl) privileges, leading to privilege escalation. The vulnerability is patched in versions 1.10.30 and 1.11.9.",
