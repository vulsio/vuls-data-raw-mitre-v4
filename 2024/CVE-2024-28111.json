	"desc": "Canarytokens helps track activity and actions on a network. Canarytokens.org supports exporting the history of a Canarytoken's incidents in CSV format. The generation of these CSV files is vulnerable to a CSV Injection vulnerability. This flaw can be used by an attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken to target the Canarytoken's owner, if the owner exports the incident history to CSV and opens in a reader application such as Microsoft Excel. The impact is that this issue could lead to code execution on the machine on which the CSV file is opened. Version sha-c595a1f8 contains a fix for this issue.",
