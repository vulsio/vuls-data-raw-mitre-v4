	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/msm/dpu: check for valid hw_pp in dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup The commit 8b45a26f2ba9 (\"drm/msm/dpu: reserve cdm blocks for writeback in case of YUV output\") introduced a smatch warning about another conditional block in dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup() which had assumed hw_pp will always be valid which may not necessarily be true. Lets fix the other conditional block by making sure hw_pp is valid before dereferencing it. Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/574878/",
