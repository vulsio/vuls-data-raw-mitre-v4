By using `DefaultQuery`, the `\"desc\"` and `\"id\"` values are used as default values if the query parameters are not set. Thus, the `order` and `sort_by` query parameter are user-controlled and are being appended to the `order` variable without any sanitization. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.beta.9.",
