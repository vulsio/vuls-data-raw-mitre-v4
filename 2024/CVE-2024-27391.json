	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: wifi: wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added Commit 09ed8bfc5215 (\"wilc1000: Rename workqueue from \"WILC_wq\" to \"NETDEV-wq\"\") moved workqueue creation in wilc_netdev_ifc_init in order to set the interface name in the workqueue name. However, while the driver needs only one workqueue, the wilc_netdev_ifc_init is called each time we add an interface over a phy, which in turns overwrite the workqueue with a new one. This can be observed with the following commands: for i in $(seq 0 10) do iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed iw dev wlan1 del done ps -eo pid,comm|grep wlan 39 kworker/R-wlan0 98 kworker/R-wlan1 102 kworker/R-wlan1 105 kworker/R-wlan1 108 kworker/R-wlan1 111 kworker/R-wlan1 114 kworker/R-wlan1 117 kworker/R-wlan1 120 kworker/R-wlan1 123 kworker/R-wlan1 126 kworker/R-wlan1 129 kworker/R-wlan1 Fix this leakage by putting back hif_workqueue allocation in wilc_cfg80211_init. Regarding the workqueue name, it is indeed relevant to set it lowercase, however it is not attached to a specific netdev, so enforcing netdev name in the name is not so relevant. Still, enrich the name with the wiphy name to make it clear which phy is using the workqueue.",
