	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: libbpf: Use OPTS_SET() macro in bpf_xdp_query() When the feature_flags and xdp_zc_max_segs fields were added to the libbpf bpf_xdp_query_opts, the code writing them did not use the OPTS_SET() macro. This causes libbpf to write to those fields unconditionally, which means that programs compiled against an older version of libbpf (with a smaller size of the bpf_xdp_query_opts struct) will have its stack corrupted by libbpf writing out of bounds. The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS) macro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not. For consistency, this fix just changes the assignments to both fields to use the OPTS_SET() macro.",
