	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: thermal/debugfs: Free all thermal zone debug memory on zone removal Because thermal_debug_tz_remove() does not free all memory allocated for thermal zone diagnostics, some of that memory becomes unreachable after freeing the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object. Address this by making thermal_debug_tz_remove() free all of the memory in question. Cc :6.8+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 6.8+",
