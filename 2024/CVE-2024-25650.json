	"desc": "Insecure key exchange between Delinea PAM Secret Server 11.4 and the Distributed Engine 8.4.3 allows a PAM administrator to obtain the Symmetric Key (used to encrypt RabbitMQ messages) via crafted payloads to the /pre-authenticate, /authenticate, and /execute-and-respond REST API endpoints. This makes it possible for a PAM administrator to impersonate the Engine and exfiltrate sensitive information from the messages published in the RabbitMQ exchanges, without being audited in the application.",
