	"desc": "A Stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) component of Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause an rpd crash, leading to Denial of Service (DoS). On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when EVPN is configured, and a specific EVPN type-5 route is received via BGP, rpd crashes and restarts. Continuous receipt of this specific route will lead to a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Junos OS: * all versions before 21.2R3-S7, * from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S5, * from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S4, * from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S2, * from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S1, * from 22.4 before 22.4R3, * from 23.2 before 23.2R2. Junos OS Evolved: * all versions before 21.4R3-S5-EVO, * from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S4-EVO, * from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S2-EVO, * from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S1-EVO, * from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO, * from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.",
