	"desc": "An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS). On all Junos OS MX Series and SRX Series platforms, when SIP ALG is enabled, and a specific SIP packet is received and processed, NAT IP allocation fails for genuine traffic, which causes Denial of Service (DoS). Continuous receipt of this specific SIP ALG packet will cause a sustained DoS condition. NAT IP usage can be monitored by running the following command. user@srx> show security nat resource-usage source-pool <source_pool_name> Pool name: source_pool_name ..
