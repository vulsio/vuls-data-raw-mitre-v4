	"desc": "An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in the advanced forwarding management process aftman of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10E, MPC11, MX10K-LC9600 line cards, MX304, and EX9200-15C, may allow an attacker to exploit a stack-based buffer overflow, leading to a reboot of the FPC. Through code review, it was determined that the interface definition code for aftman could read beyond a buffer boundary, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow. This issue affects Junos OS on MX Series and EX9200-15C: * from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S1, * from 21.4 before 21.4R3, * from 22.1 before 22.1R2, * from 22.2 before 22.2R2; This issue does not affect: * versions of Junos OS prior to 20.3R1; * any version of Junos OS 20.4.",
