On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when traffic engineering is enabled for OSPF or ISIS, and a link flaps, a patroot memory leak is observed. This memory leak, over time, will lead to an rpd crash and restart. The memory usage can be monitored using the below command. user@host> show task memory detail | match patroot This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS * All versions earlier than 21.2R3-S3; * 21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5; * 21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S3; * 22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3; * 22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3.
