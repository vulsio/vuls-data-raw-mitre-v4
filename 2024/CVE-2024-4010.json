This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to cause a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, by performing multiple unauthorized actions. Some of these actions could also be leveraged to conduct PHP Object Injection and SQL Injection attacks.",
