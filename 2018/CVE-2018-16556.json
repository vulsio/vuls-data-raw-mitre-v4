SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-400 H V6 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V6.0.9), SIMATIC S7-400 PN/DP V6 and below CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-410 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V8.2.1), SIPLUS S7-400 CPU 414-3 PN/DP V7 (All versions < V7.0.3), SIPLUS S7-400 CPU 416-3 PN/DP V7 (All versions < V7.0.3), SIPLUS S7-400 CPU 416-3 V7 (All versions), SIPLUS S7-400 CPU 417-4 V7 (All versions). Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS, or via Multi Point Interfaces (MPI) could cause the affected devices to go into defect mode. Manual reboot is required to resume normal operation. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI). No user interaction and no user privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a denial of service condition of the core functionality of the CPU, compromising the availability of the system.",
