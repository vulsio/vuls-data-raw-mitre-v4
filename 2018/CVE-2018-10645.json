  "desc": "Golden Frog VyprVPN 2.12.1.8015 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability through the \"VyprVPN\" service. This service establishes a NetNamedPipe endpoint that allows applications to connect and call publicly exposed methods. The \"SetProperty\" method allows an attacker to configure the \"AdditionalOpenVpnParameters\" property and control the OpenVPN command line. Using the OpenVPN \"plugin\" parameter, an attacker may specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user. This attack may be conducted using \"VyprVPN Free\" account credentials and the VyprVPN Desktop Client.",
