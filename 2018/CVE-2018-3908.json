  "desc": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the REST parser of video-core's HTTP server of the Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250-Firmware version 0.20.17. The video-core process incorrectly handles pipelined HTTP requests, which allows successive requests to overwrite the previously parsed HTTP method, URL and body. With the implementation of the on_body callback, defined by sub_41734, an attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.",
