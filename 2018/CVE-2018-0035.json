  "desc": "QFX5200 and QFX10002 devices that have been shipped with Junos OS 15.1X53-D21, 15.1X53-D30, 15.1X53-D31, 15.1X53-D32, 15.1X53-D33 and 15.1X53-D60 or have been upgraded to these releases using the .bin or .iso images may contain an unintended additional Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) partition. This additional partition allows the superuser to reboot to the ONIE partition which will wipe out the content of the Junos partition and its configuration. Once rebooted, the ONIE partition will not have root password configured, thus any user can access the console or SSH, using an IP address acquired from DHCP, as root without password. Once the device has been shipped or upgraded with the ONIE partition installed, the issue will persist. Simply upgrading to higher release via the CLI will not resolve the issue. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.",
