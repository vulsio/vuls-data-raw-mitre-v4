  "desc": "A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation for Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition when the device unexpectedly reloads. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain type, length, value (TLV) fields of the LLDP frame header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to reload unexpectedly.",
