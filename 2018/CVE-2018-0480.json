The vulnerability is due to a race condition that occurs when the VLAN and port enter an errdisabled state, resulting in an incorrect state in the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending frames that trigger the errdisable condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash, leading to a DoS condition.",
