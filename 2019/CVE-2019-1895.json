  "desc": "A vulnerability in the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) console implementation of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the VNC console session of an administrative user on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an insufficient authentication mechanism used to establish a VNC session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting an administrator VNC session request prior to login. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to watch the administrator console session or interact with it, allowing admin access to the affected device.",
