  "desc": "Rapid7 Insight Agent, version 2.6.3 and prior, suffers from a local privilege escalation due to an uncontrolled DLL search path. Specifically, when Insight Agent 2.6.3 and prior starts, the Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at \"C:\\DLLs\\python3.dll,\" which normally is writable by locally authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local user could use Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 2.6.4.",
