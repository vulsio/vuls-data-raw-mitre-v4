The web management interface (setup.cgi) has an authentication bypass and other problems that ultimately allow an attacker to remotely compromise the device from a malicious webpage. The attacker sends an FW_remote.htm&todo=cfg_init request without a cookie, reads the Set-Cookie header in the 401 Unauthorized response, and then repeats the FW_remote.htm&todo=cfg_init request with the specified cookie.",
