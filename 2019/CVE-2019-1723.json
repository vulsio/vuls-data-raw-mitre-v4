An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to the affected system using this account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the CSPC using the default account. For Cisco CSPC 2.7.x, Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Release 2.7.4.6. For Cisco CSPC 2.8.x, Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Release 2.8.1.2.",
