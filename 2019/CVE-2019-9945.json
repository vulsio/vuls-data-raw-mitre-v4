  "desc": "SoftNAS Cloud 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 allows remote command execution. The NGINX default configuration file has a check to verify the status of a user cookie. If not set, a user is redirected to the login page. An arbitrary value can be provided for this cookie to access the web interface without valid user credentials. If customers have not followed SoftNAS deployment best practices and expose SoftNAS StorageCenter ports directly to the internet, this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to the Webadmin interface to create new users or execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges, compromising both the platform and the data.",
