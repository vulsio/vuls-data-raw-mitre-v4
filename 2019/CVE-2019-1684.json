The vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet header fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet to the targeted phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected phone to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary DoS condition. Versions prior to 12.6(1)MN80 are affected.",
