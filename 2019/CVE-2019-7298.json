	"desc": "An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-823G devices with firmware through 1.02B03. A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted /HNAP1 request. This occurs when any HNAP API function triggers a call to the system function with untrusted input from the request body, such as a body of ' /bin/telnetd' for the GetDeviceSettingsset API function. Consequently, an attacker can execute any command remotely when they control this input.",
