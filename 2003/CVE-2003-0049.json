			"text": "Realizing they have acknowledged the problem, and provided a fix by allowing the administrator to select whether or not this is allowed,\nI am not sure this should really be a vulnerability.  If you are the administrator on a system, there are other ways I can become a user\non a system.  The fact that you are the administrator (root) you can do almost anything to the system you want, including accessing files\nand programs that belong to other users.  From a security standpoint, if the system gets \"hacked\" and the administrator account is compromised,\nhow big of an issue is it really that the administrator can now access regular user accounts with the administrator password?  I am not sure this\nshould really be a vulnerability.",
