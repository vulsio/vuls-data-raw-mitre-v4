HP acknowledges CVE-2001-0551 by stating\nthat the problem is fixed in HP:HPSBUX0105-151, which\nis CVE-2001-0772.  But CVE-2001-0772 is a vague advisory\nthat identifies other vulnerabilities (and vulnerability\ntypes) besides CVE-2001-0551.  Perhaps CVE-2001-0772 should\nbe RECAST to \"remove\" the reference to dtprintinfo and\nleave the other vague descriptions.  CVE-2001-0772 and\nCVE-2001-0551 are very good examples of the problems that\nCVE faces in being consistent with respect to the level of\nabstraction, as documented in the CD:SF-CODEBASE, CD:SF-LOC,\nand CD:VAGUE content decisions.",
