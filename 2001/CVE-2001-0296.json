Appears from ref that this problem has been in every version since the 2.40 problem reported Oct 1999 (CVE 1999-0950).  Just managed to change the code so it requires more characters to overflow the buffer.  I haven't tested this, but just from the available documentation, these problems look like a continuation of the early one.",
