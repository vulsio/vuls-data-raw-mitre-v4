      "text": "According to an email message from the vendor\n(bcoveney@4d.com) on March 13, 2002, this problem is only\npossible if the server admin has already configured the\nserver's web root to be at the top-level folder.  This is not\nthe default.  As such, any \"directory traversal\" attack would\nnot escape above the folder that has already been specified by\nthe admin.  Since this is a generic misconfiguration problem\nfor all web servers, and not a default configuration of ACI\n4D, then this candidate should not be included in CVE.\n\nThe quote from the vendor is: \"By default the 4D WebServer\ndoesn't have this behavior. A property has to be turned on to allow\nthis (despite our warnings of the consequences). We don't allow pages\noutside of our web folder to be served but if the developer of the\nsite wishes they can set the webroot folder to be whatever they\nwant. In the system that 'krfinisterre@checkfree.com' evaluated the\ndeveloper had chosen to set their root folder to be the root of the\ncomputer system (C:\\) and therefore all the files on the system were\navailable. By default we set the root folder at the same level as the\ndatabase folder so this doesn't happen. You cannot look at any files\noutside the designated WebFolder root tree.\"",
