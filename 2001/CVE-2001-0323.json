	"desc": "The ICMP path MTU (PMTU) discovery feature in various UNIX systems allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by spoofing \"ICMP Fragmentation needed but Don't Fragment (DF) set\" packets between two target hosts, which could cause one host to lower its MTU when transmitting to the other host.",

		{
			"text": "It seems obvious that if one sets the MTU to just one byte\nabove the size of a IP header (let's say 21 bytes), data transmission\nis not going to go anywhere fast, as the overhead will be 20 times the\npayload...  As I said for another candidate, ICMP messages should not\nbe acted upon without access control.  I'm not sure that references to\nUNIX should be kept.  It seems that this should work with any OS.  It\nwould be nasty if some OSes accepted an MTU of 20, as you could not\ntransmit any IP data.",
