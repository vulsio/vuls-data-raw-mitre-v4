      "text": "There is evidence that this problem was confirmed by Trend,\nbut there are some inconsistencies.\nMISC:http://solutionbank.antivirus.com/solutions/solutionDetail.asp?solutionID=9682\nNote, however, that the date of the patch description at\nMISC:http://solutionfile.trendmicro.com/SolutionFile/9682/en/ReadMe-BufferOverflowPatch.txt\nis June 19th, but the Bugtraq post was July 2, and the poster\nsaid that a patch had not been available yet.  However, the\nposter also said that they had notified Trend on June 11.\nAdd that the Action parameter is the one with the overflow.\n\nThis patch description only identifies HttpSave.dll, not\nRegGo.dll (as identified by CVE-2001-0678), but it implies\nthat multiple DLL's may have been fixed.  Looking at the DLL's\nin the patch, there is RegGo.dll and a number of other DLL's.\nHowever, this RegGo.dll is different than the one from\nthe patch for CVE-2001-0678, so maybe they fixed yet another\nproblem here.\n\nThat problem might be:\nBUGTRAQ:20010621 TrendMicro InterScan WebManager Version 1.2 RegGo.dll Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\nURL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/192645\nwhere the discloser said that the problem was discovered\nin June 6 and implied that Trend Micro would fix the problem,\nso Trend was notified sometime between June 6 and June 21.\nSo, the dates might imply that Trend fixed both the\nHTTPSave.dll and this variant (if in fact it's a variant and\nnot a rediscovery of CVE-2001-0678) in a single patch.\nIf true, then that would argue that this candidate should be \nmerged with the RegGo.dll variant reported in the above\nBugtraq reference, along with some of the other DLL's - just\nin case someone rediscovers THOSE, too.\n\nOther DLL's in this patch are covered in other posts\nin the same time frame by the same person.\nHttpSaveCVP.dll and HttpSaveCSP.dll are in:\nBUGTRAQ:20010628 [SNS Advisory No.35] TrendMicro InterScan VirusWall 3.51 HttpSaveC*P.dll Buffer Overflow\nURL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2001-06/0388.html\nsmtpscan.dll is described in:\nBUGTRAQ:20010628 [SNS Advisory No.34] TrendMicro InterScan VirusWall 3.51 smtpscan.dll Buffer Overflow\nURL:http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2001-06/0387.html",
