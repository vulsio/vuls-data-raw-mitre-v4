This is limited to the files saned can access (usually\nit's running as user \"sane\"). All pnm files can be read if saned runs\nas root which isn't recommended anyway. The pnm backend is disabled\nby default. If you want to use it, enable it with configure (see \nconfigure --help for details). Be sure that only trusted users can\naccess the pnm backend over saned.\n\n---cut---",
