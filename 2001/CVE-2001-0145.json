The reference for 2000-0756 states that there is a\nbuffer overflow in the birthday AND the e-mail field, as well as other\nsuspected fields. As this current candidate only addresses the\nbirthday field, it seems that there are likely different lines of code\ninvolved.\nMicrosoft is not specific about what specifically the patch\naddresses. It is possible that the other overflows in 2000-0756 are\nstill vulnerable and that the @stake group just didn't bother to test\nthem.\nWe will not know the answer until someone retests those other\nfields to see if they are still vulnerable.\nIf they are, then 2000-0756 might deserve being split up.",
