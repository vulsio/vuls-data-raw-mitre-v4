			"text": "The preconditions needed to obtain the clear-text backup file\nare that the user must be able to read the raw disk. Only administrators\nor those with physical access can read the raw disk. An admin could\nalter the operating system such that anything a user did would be\navailable, even EFS information (since the admin can cause processes to\nrun as any user who is logged on currently). Thus even if this issue\nwere not present, the same set of preconditions would lead to access to\nthe same information. In the case of physical access, scrubbing the disk\nshould be viewed only as raising the bar - information can be recovered\neven from overwritten sectors. Additionally, coverage of a file might\nnot be complete - in the case where a file is truncated, then encrypted,\nthere could be sectors with file information that the operating system\nwould have no knowledge of at the time the encryption occurred, and\nthere is no practical way to wipe these. Considering all the realities\nof the situation, the only real-world solution is to create files you'd\nlike encrypted in a directory marked for encryption.",
