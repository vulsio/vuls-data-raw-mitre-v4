			"text": "I would argue that a browser executing a script when it shouldn't is still a vulnerability.  If it is supposed to be a non-scriptable file type, and that fails, resulting in a script being executed without the user's knowledge, then it is a problem, and thus should be included as a vulnerability.  I vote this should be accepted, and if Microsoft acknowledges this in their follow up, then you have vendor acknowledgement of the problem as well.",
