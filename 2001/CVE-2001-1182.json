As quoted in\nthe CERT advisory for CVE-2001-0797, HP says:\n\"HP-UX does have a benign buffer overflow... [which] has been\nfixed by HP.\"  HP:HPSBUX0107-160 (CVE-2001-1182) states that\n\"The login(1) command allows restricted shell users to\ncircumvent security checks\" which could be interpreted as\nmeaning that HP has found a slightly less-than-benign aspect\nof the overflow, but since (a) the advisory says nothing about\noverflows and (b) the advisory does not include any\ncross-references, it cannot be clear.  There is a difference\nin the release dates as well, however, since the HP advisory\nwas released in July 2001 and this CAN was publicized in\nDecember 2001, which may be sufficient evidence that the\nproblems are different.\n\nThis probably is not the same issue in login as CVE-2001-0978,\nsince different patches are referenced in that CAN.\n\nThere is insufficient information to know whether this is the\nsame issue as CVE-2001-0094 (kerberos library issues that\naffect kerberized login).",
