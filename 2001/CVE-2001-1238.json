      "text": "I don't think this is really a vulnerability.  If I am not mistaken,\nthose are \"services\" which have to be managed by the services control\nin windows 2K.  This keeps users from killing things the system has\nto have.  I don't think it is possible to kill another of other services\nin this manner either.  Try it on almost any W2K system, and there are any\nnumber of services that you cannot kill from the process tab, rather you\nmust go to the services controller to stop the service.\nI vote to reject this, as this is not a vulnerability, since you would have\nto be administrator on the system to change one of these services to a trojan\nversion anyway.",
