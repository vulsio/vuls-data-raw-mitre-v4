	"desc": "The Foreign Function Interface (ffi) extension in PHP 5.0.5 does not follow safe_mode restrictions, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code by loading an arbitrary DLL and calling a function, as demonstrated by kernel32.dll and the WinExec function.  NOTE: this issue does not cross privilege boundaries in most contexts, so perhaps it should not be included in CVE.",
