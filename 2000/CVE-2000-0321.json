      "text": "Alan DeKok <aland@FREERADIUS.ORG> says it applies to other RADIUS\nprograms also, *however* since it needs a valid username, only\nthe RADIUS owner can exploit it by changing the config file.  But\nif the config file can be written by others - well, that's still\na potential risk, but you've probably got bigger problems then.\n- http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bugtraq&m=95671883515060&w=2\nLook at ChangeLog at ftp://ftp.cheapnet.net/pub/icradius/ChangeLog\n\nPossible confirmation in 0.15: \"sql_getvpdata now dynamically\nallocates buffer sizes for sql queries to avoid over runs\"\n\nBut that's a bit general.\n\nAlan Kok said that Cistron and other RADIUS servers were affected; the\nICRADIUS changelog says to check the Cistron logs for other possible\nbug fixes, since ICRADIUS uses Cistron codebase.  Go back to\nfreeradius.org and find link to Cistron at\nhttp://www.miquels.cistron.nl/radius/\n\nCistron changelog at http://www.miquels.cistron.nl/radius/ChangeLog It\nhas different version numbers - go back to ICRADIUS changelog to find\nrought equivalents.  ICRADIUS 0.15 uses Cistron 1.6.3 patches, so\nstart from there.\n\nNo apparent problems in 1.6.3 or 1.6.4, but 1.6.1 says: \"Fix all\nstrcpy(), strcat(), sprintf() and sccanf() calls for buffer\noverflows.\"  So perhaps the problem was fixed then?  Or maybe the\nvulnerable sscanf() call was missed and/or disregarded because it was\nbelieved that the hostname could be trusted since it came from a\nwell-controlled configuration file?",
