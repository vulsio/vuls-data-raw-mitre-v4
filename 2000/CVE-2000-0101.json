      "text": "I would combine all of these shopping cart applications into one listing, \nsince they all have the same vulnerability being able to modify sensitive \npurchase information via hidden form fields.  My concern is in cases like \nthis we used over 10 entries for basically the same vulnerability.  I could \nthink of cases were there could be 20+ applications with the same \nvulnerability and in my opinion it could start to weaken the value of CVE \nwhere there are 30 entries all referring to the same thing.  It is almost \nlike we are playing the vendor game where more is better.  I think we \nshould go after the quality over quantity aspect.",

      "text": "I disagree with Eric here.  This vulnerability is a \"type\" of\nproblem in the same way that a buffer overflow is a \"type\" of\nproblem.  While the shopping cart application bugs were\nproposed mostly at the same time, they are all by different\nvendors.\n\nThe raw numbers of applications with this problem can make it\nappear that CVE is artificially inflating the number of\nentries.   However, content decisions such as CD:SF-LOC\n(different lines of code) dictate that these should be\nseparated.  It's not a \"numbers game\" but rather a principled\nand consistent approach to resolving problems with\nselecting a level of abstraction.",
