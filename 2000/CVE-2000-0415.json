The data feeds may report\nthese problems as new before corrections are posted.\nFollowups do often lend additional information to the\ncandidates, and as is the case with this one, we will\noften catch the discrepancy before the candidate becomes an\nofficial entry, whether by MITRE's own analysis or by that\nof other Board members.",
