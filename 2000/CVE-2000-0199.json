In\nWindows Integrated Security mode passwords are never stored,\nas your Windows Domain sign-on is used as the security\nidentifier to the database server.\"\n\nWe still must consider approving this candidate, however, as a\nuser configuration error instead of a software flaw.\nCD:DESIGN-WEAK-ENCRYPTION applies in this case, so if we\ndecide to include configuration problems in which a user\nintentionally selects weak encryption, then we might still\napprove this candidate.",
