In addition,\nthey could not find conclusive evidence that RS 3.2.2 or 5.0\nwas affected by IP fragmentation.  This seems to indicate\nthat there are 2 *possible* problems: syn flooding (acknowledged\nby ISS) and fragmentation (unconfirmed).  Perhaps this\ncandidate needs to be split, or its description should be\nrewritten to separate the 2 reported problems.",
