Instead, since we are at at higher\nabstraction level, that we make the class include those master/slave\ntool combinations that are used for malicious purposes (i.e. DDOS,\ndata exfiltration, or whatever the appropriate classes of effect are).\n\nMy concern is that (1) we treat all distributed attacks at the same\nabstract level; not just the DDOS ones.  Second, if it is at a higher\nabstraction level then it seems right to unlimit it (by including\nmaster/slave combinations in general; not just the DDOS asect).",

			"text": "I think that trinoo etc... are very similar to smurf attacks\n(CVE-1999-0513 ) in the sense that a third party allows itself to be\nused.  Also, there is an  obvious solution that can only be done by\nthat third party.\n\nAs for the CVE entry, I am considering whether the common entry point\ncould be reduced to \"egress filtering has not been implemented or has\nbeen disabled, allowing the sending of spoofed IP packets\".\nIncidentally, this would prevent the use of decoys in port scans,\netc...  This single CVE entry would be very powerful. We could use\nthe dot notation to list the DDoS tools and attacks that rely on the\nabsence of egress filtering based on the argument that if you have\negress filtering, nobody will bother to put or use DDoS tools on your\ncomputers.\n\nThe weakness of this is that one could in theory still use DDoS tools\neven if you have egress filtering -- only they will be one shot guns,\nalmost completely eliminating their appeal and effectiveness.  One\nuse, and they will be blocked, tracked down and destroyed\nefficiently.\n\nPascal\n\nP.S.: I am attracted by the idea of starting an internet (fire)wall\nof shame, for people who haven't implemented egress filtering.  It\nworked pretty well against sites allowing themselves to be used for\nsmurf attacks (http://www.powertech.no/smurf/).  Why not use the same\nstrategy for egress filtering?  Of course it's hard to know who is\nthe source of IP spoofed  packets.  However the consistent detection\nof crud originating from a server is a sure sign that they haven't\nimplemented egress filtering.  For example (my first candidate to\nthis wall of shame), this weekend the Linux suse ftp server sent many\npackets with an illegal ip address as source, one reserved for local\narea networks, upon making an ftp connection (it may still be doing\nit, I haven't checked since -- the suse ftp admin mentioned that they\nwere aware of it).  It was easy to figure out it was them by\nrepeating the ftp connections and observing the 100% reproducibility\nand time correlation of the extraneous packets.  In addition, the\nsuse servers kept sending me crud for *hours* after a failed attempt\nto download their PPC beta.\n\nThe cost of egress filtering is easily justified.  The argument is\nsimilar to those relating to pollution, excepted that people don't\ntry to break into your car if you have removed the catalytic\nconverter.",

My\ninclination is to group master and slave by package; i.e., trinoo\nmaster/slave, tfn master/slave, etc.\n",

		{
			"text": "What they have in common is the use of an amplification mechanism.\nThey are broadcasting (multicasting) to a (virtual private) network,\nwhich then amplifies the messages.  In both cases, the amplification\nis done by the third party victim hosts.  The difference is just that\nthe network is virtual instead of physical.\n\n\nScott, you are assuming that the people who have the tools installed\nare unwilling.  Let's say theoretically speaking that there is an\nunderground hacker group (or student association) who is hooked up to\nDSL lines (like in university residences) and who thinks that it\nwould be \"cool\" to form an \"army\".  How about a popular civil\nmovement protesting something, like the WTO last summer?  I think\nsome people would voluntarily \"enlist\" their computers in a cause\nthat would use DDoS attacks.  The rootkit analogy does not hold, yet\nthe DDoS attacks could be just as effective.  However, if the\nuniversity or ISPs implemented egress filtering, the DDoS attacks\ncould be easily stopped because the people could be held accountable.\nThe crux of the matter is the anonymity provided by IP spoofing.\n\nYou are correct that in most cases, having a DDoS tool installed on\nyour system is an exposure like rootkit.  Maybe that deserves a CVE\nentry.  However, I think that does not capture the nature of the\nDDoS, and that an entry about egress filtering is of utmost\nimportance because it patches a fundamental vulnerability of IPv4.",

			"text": "Excellent response, Pascal, thanks.  I hadn't thought of people\nvolunteering, but that's certainly a plausible scenario.  Part of my\nmotivation/thinking was a desire to stay away from making this into only\nyet another use for spoofed IP packets.  I wholeheartedly agree that\negress filtering essential, but am reluctant to single out the recent DDoS\nevents as the reason for it.\n\nI'd prefer to split out egress filtering as a seperate CVE entry (on the\ntheory that not using egress filtering constitutes an exposure -- at least\nto liability), rather than tying it to these entries.",
