		{
			"text": "As Andre basically said without naming content decisions,\nCD:SF-LOC says this should be split.\n\nHOWEVER - the author of the product says that WindMail isn't\nsupposed to be a CGI script, and says that the pipe \ncharacter problem is not related to Geocel.  So should CVE\nrecord when someone runs a program that wasn't intended to\nbe a CGI?  There may be a level of abstraction issue here.\nNote that Perl and shell interpreters in CGI-BIN are \nalready mentioned in CVE-1999-0509.  If we want to include\n\"using a program that wasn't designed to be a CGI\" as a\nproblem, we should have a separate candidate.\n\nSee the author's comments at:\nhttp://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&msg=3.0.5.32.20000331114325.013af680@mailhost.geocel.com\n\nwhich also claims that the original announcer hasn't provided\nany more details after the author was unable to reproduce the\nproblem.",
