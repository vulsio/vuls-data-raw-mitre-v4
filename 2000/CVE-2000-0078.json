According to Tripp (bugtraq), the audio server doesn't run on a machine without Audio Hardware (logical).  So one has to assume from the bulletin that any 9000 with audio hardware that is running a 10.x or 11.x version of OS with either the 98 or 99 version of Aserver loaded will be vulnerable to either the exploit in CVE-1999-0005(the 98 version of Aserver) or CVE-2000-0078 (the 99 version)and should take appropriate action.  No patches out from HP as of 10/2/2000 so either remove the program or tighten the permissions considerably.",
