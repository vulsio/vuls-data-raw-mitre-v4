This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients. Applications using only the in-memory filesystem supported by go-git are not affected by this vulnerability. This is a go-git implementation issue and does not affect the upstream git cli.",
