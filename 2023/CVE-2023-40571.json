	"desc": "weblogic-framework is a tool for detecting weblogic vulnerabilities. Versions 0.2.3 and prior do not verify the returned data packets, and there is a deserialization vulnerability which may lead to remote code execution. When weblogic-framework gets the command echo, it directly deserializes the data returned by the server without verifying it. At the same time, the classloader loads a lot of deserialization calls. In this case, the malicious serialized data returned by the server will cause remote code execution. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.",
