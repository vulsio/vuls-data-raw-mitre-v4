  "desc": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.1 through 0.3.7, the Vyper compiler generates the wrong bytecode. Any contract that uses the `raw_call` with `revert_on_failure=False` and `max_outsize=0` receives the wrong response from `raw_call`. Depending on the memory garbage, the result can be either `True` or `False`. A patch is available and, as of time of publication, anticipated to be part of Vyper 0.3.8. As a workaround, one may always put `max_outsize>0`.",
