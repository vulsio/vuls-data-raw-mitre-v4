  "desc": "Security vulnerability in Apache bRPC <1.5.0 on all platforms allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via ServerOptions::pid_file. An attacker that can influence the ServerOptions pid_file parameter with which the bRPC server is started can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the bRPC process. Solution: 1. upgrade to bRPC >= 1.5.0, download link: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/brpc/1.5.0/ https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/brpc/1.5.0/ 2. If you are using an old version of bRPC and hard to upgrade, you can apply this patch: https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2218 https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2218",
