	"desc": "quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Starting in version 0.37.0 and prior to version 0.37.3, by serializing an ACK frame after the CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number space. An attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving a few packets. Version 0.37.3 contains a patch. Versions before 0.37.0 are not affected.",
