  "desc": "An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series, EX2300, EX3400, EX4100, EX4400 and EX4600 allows a adjacent attacker to send specific traffic, which leads to packet flooding, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). When a specific IGMP packet is received in an isolated VLAN, it is duplicated to all other ports under the primary VLAN, which causes a flood. This issue affects QFX5000 series, EX2300, EX3400, EX4100, EX4400 and EX4600 platforms only. This issue affects Juniper Junos OS on on QFX5000 Series, EX2300, EX3400, EX4100, EX4400 and EX4600: * All versions prior to 20.4R3-S5; * 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4; * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S3; * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5; * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S2; * 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3; * 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3; * 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2.",
