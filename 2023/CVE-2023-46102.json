The protocol builds on top of MQTT to implement the remote management of the device is encrypted with a hard-coded DES symmetric key, that can be retrieved reversing both the Android Client application and the server-side web application. This issue allows an attacker able to control a malicious MQTT broker on the same subnet network of the device, to craft malicious messages and send them to the HMI device, executing arbitrary commands on the device itself.",
