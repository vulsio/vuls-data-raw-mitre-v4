	"desc": "LibreY is a fork of LibreX, a framework-less and javascript-free privacy respecting meta search engine. LibreY is subject to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `engines/google/text.php` and `engines/duckduckgo/text.php` files in versions before commit be59098abd119cda70b15bf3faac596dfd39a744. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to request the server to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks via the `wikipedia_language` cookie. Remote attackers can request the server to download large files to reduce the performance of the server or even deny access from legitimate users. This issue has been patched in https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/9. LibreY hosters are advised to use the latest commit. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
