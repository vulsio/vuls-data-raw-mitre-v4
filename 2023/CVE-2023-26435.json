	"desc": "It was possible to call filesystem and network references using the local LibreOffice instance using manipulated ODT documents. Attackers could discover restricted network topology and services as well as including local files with read permissions of the open-xchange system user. This was limited to specific file-types, like images. We have improved existing content filters and validators to avoid including any local resources. No publicly available exploits are known.",
