  "desc": "The vulnerability is an intent redirection in LG ThinQ Service (\"com.lge.lms2\") in the \"com/lge/lms/things/ui/notification/NotificationManager.java\" file. This vulnerability could be exploited by a third-party app installed on an LG device by sending a broadcast with the action \"com.lge.lms.things.notification.ACTION\". Additionally, this vulnerability is very dangerous because LG ThinQ Service is a system app (having android:sharedUserId=\"android.uid.system\" setting). Intent redirection in this app leads to accessing arbitrary not exported activities of absolutely all apps.",
