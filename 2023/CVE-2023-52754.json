	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media: imon: fix access to invalid resource for the second interface imon driver probes two USB interfaces, and at the probe of the second interface, the driver assumes blindly that the first interface got bound with the same imon driver. It's usually true, but it's still possible that the first interface is bound with another driver via a malformed descriptor. Then it may lead to a memory corruption, as spotted by syzkaller; imon driver accesses the data from drvdata as struct imon_context object although it's a completely different one that was assigned by another driver. This patch adds a sanity check -- whether the first interface is really bound with the imon driver or not -- for avoiding the problem above at the probe time.",
