  "desc": "An Improper Release of Memory Before Removing Last Reference vulnerability in Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low privileged attacker to cause an FPC crash, leading to Denial of Service (DoS). On all Junos MX Series with MPC1 - MPC9, LC480, LC2101, MX10003, and MX80, when Connectivity-Fault-Management (CFM) is enabled in a VPLS scenario, and a specific LDP related command is run, an FPC will crash and reboot. Continued execution of this specific LDP command can lead to sustained Denial of Service condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series: * All versions prior to 20.4R3-S7; * 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5; * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S4; * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4; * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3; * 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S1; * 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2-S1, 22.2R3; * 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R1-S2, 22.3R2.",
