	"desc": "Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform. Prior to version 10.5.19, quoting is not done properly in UUID DAO model. There is the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the DAO class. Users should update to version 10.5.19 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, apply the patch manually.",
