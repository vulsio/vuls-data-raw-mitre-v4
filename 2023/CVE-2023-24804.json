  "desc": "The ownCloud Android app allows ownCloud users to access, share, and edit files and folders. Prior to version 3.0, the app has an incomplete fix for a path traversal issue and is vulnerable to two bypass methods. The bypasses may lead to information disclosure when uploading the appâ€™s internal files, and to arbitrary file write when uploading plain text files (although limited by the .txt extension). Version 3.0 fixes the reported bypasses.",
