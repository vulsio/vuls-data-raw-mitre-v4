	"desc": "The React Developer Tools extension registers a message listener with window.addEventListener('message', <listener>) in a content script that is accessible to any webpage that is active in the browser. Within the listener is code that requests a URL derived from the received message via fetch(). The URL is not validated or sanitised before it is fetched, thus allowing a malicious web page to arbitrarily fetch URLâ€™s via the victim's browser.",
