This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-X3260 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the prog.cgi binary, which handles HNAP requests made to the lighttpd webserver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length an user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20774.",
