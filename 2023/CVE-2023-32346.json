  "desc": "Teltonikaâ€™s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 contain a function that allows users to claim their devices. This function returns information based on whether the serial number of a device has already been claimed, the MAC address of a device has already been claimed, or whether the attempt to claim a device was successful. An attacker could exploit this to create a list of the serial numbers and MAC addresses of all devices cloud-connected to the Remote Management System.",
