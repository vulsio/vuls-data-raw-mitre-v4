  "desc": "An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in the flow processing daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges, to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). If a low privileged user executes a specific CLI command, flowd which is responsible for traffic forwarding in SRX crashes and generates a core dump. This will cause temporary traffic interruption until the flowd process is restarted automatically. Continued execution of this command will lead to a sustained DoS. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: All versions prior to 20.2R3-S7; 20.3 version 20.3R1 and later versions; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S6; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S4; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S1; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3; 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2; 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S1, 22.4R2.",
