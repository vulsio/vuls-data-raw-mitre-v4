	"phase": {
		"text": "Assigned",
		"date": "20231124"
	},
	"desc": "OpenZFS through 2.1.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.1, in certain scenarios involving applications that try to rely on efficient copying of file data, can replace file contents with zero-valued bytes and thus potentially disable security mechanisms. NOTE: this issue is not always security related, but can be security related in realistic situations. A possible example is cp, from a recent GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) version, when attempting to preserve a rule set for denying unauthorized access. (One might use cp when configuring access control, such as with the /etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM Support reference.) NOTE: this issue occurs less often in version 2.2.1, and in versions before 2.1.4, because of the default configuration in those versions.",
