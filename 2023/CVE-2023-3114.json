  "desc": "Terraform Enterprise since v202207-1 did not properly implement authorization rules for agent pools, allowing the workspace to be targeted by unauthorized agents. This authorization flaw could potentially allow a workspace to access resources from a separate, higher-privileged workspace in the same organization that targeted an agent pool. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-3114, is fixed in Terraform Enterprise v202306-1.",
