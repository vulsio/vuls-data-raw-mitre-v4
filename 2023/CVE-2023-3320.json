  "desc": "The WP Sticky Social plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/admin/views/admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
