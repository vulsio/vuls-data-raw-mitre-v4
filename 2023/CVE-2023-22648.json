	"desc": "A Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in SUSE Rancher causes permission changes in Azure AD not to be reflected to users while they are logged in the Rancher UI. This would cause the users to retain their previous permissions in Rancher, even if they change groups on Azure AD, for example, to a lower privileged group, or are removed from a group, thus retaining their access to Rancher instead of losing it. This issue affects Rancher: from >= 2.6.7 before < 2.6.13, from >= 2.7.0 before < 2.7.4.",
