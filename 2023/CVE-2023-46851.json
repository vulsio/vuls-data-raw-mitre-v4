  "desc": "Allura Discussion and Allura Forum importing does not restrict URL values specified in attachments. Project administrators can run these imports, which could cause Allura to read local files and expose them. Exposing internal files then can lead to other exploits, like session hijacking, or remote code execution. This issue affects Apache Allura from 1.0.1 through 1.15.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.16.0, which fixes the issue. If you are unable to upgrade, set \"disable_entry_points.allura.importers = forge-tracker, forge-discussion\" in your .ini config file.",
