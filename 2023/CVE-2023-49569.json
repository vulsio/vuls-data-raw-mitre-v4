	"desc": "A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.11. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create and amend files across the filesystem. In the worse case scenario, remote code execution could be achieved. Applications are only affected if they are using the ChrootOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#ChrootOS , which is the default when using \"Plain\" versions of Open and Clone funcs (e.g. PlainClone). Applications using BoundOS https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-billy/v5/osfs#BoundOS or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue. This is a go-git implementation issue and does not affect the upstream git cli.",
