This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious Bluetooth device. The specific flaw exists within the handling of OBEX protocol parameters.
