The known risks include a denial of service due to the WebSocket Proxy accepting any connections, and excessive data transfer due to misuse of the WebSocket ping/pong feature. 2.10 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.5. 2.11 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.2. 3.0 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.1. 3.1 Pulsar WebSocket Proxy users are unaffected.
