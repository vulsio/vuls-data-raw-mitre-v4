This vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain access to LAN-side services on affected installations of TP-Link Archer AX21 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the hotplugd daemon. The issue results from firewall rule handling that allows an attacker access to resources that should be available to the LAN interface only. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the root user. Was ZDI-CAN-19664.",
