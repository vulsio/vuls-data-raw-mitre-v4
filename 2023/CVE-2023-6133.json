  "desc": "The Forminator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient blacklisting on the 'forminator_allowed_mime_types' function in versions up to, and including, 1.27.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator-level capabilities or above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server, but due to the htaccess configuration, remote code cannot be executed.",
