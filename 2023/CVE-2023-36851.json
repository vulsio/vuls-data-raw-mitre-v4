	"desc": "A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity. With a specific request to webauth_operation.php that doesn't require authentication, an attacker is able to upload and download arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of integrity or confidentiality, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S8; * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S6; * 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S5; * 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S3; * 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R3-S2; * 22.4 versions prior to 22,4R2-S2, 22.4R3; * 23.2 versions prior to 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.",
