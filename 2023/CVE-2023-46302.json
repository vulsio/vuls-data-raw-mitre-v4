	"desc": "Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471 . Apache Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints. In order to handle YAML requests (using application/yaml content-type), it defines a YamlEntityProvider entity provider that will process all incoming YAML requests. In order to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method is invoked, passing the entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`. We have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`. This issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue. If using the version smaller than 0.8.0 and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054 and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this.",
