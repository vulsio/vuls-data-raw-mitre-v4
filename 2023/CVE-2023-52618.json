	"desc": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: block/rnbd-srv: Check for unlikely string overflow Since \"dev_search_path\" can technically be as large as PATH_MAX, there was a risk of truncation when copying it and a second string into \"full_path\" since it was also PATH_MAX sized. The W=1 builds were reporting this warning: drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c: In function 'process_msg_open.isra': drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:616:51: warning: '%s' directive output may be truncated writing up to 254 bytes into a region of size between 0 and 4095 [-Wformat-truncation=] 616 | snprintf(full_path, PATH_MAX, \"%s/%s\", | ^~ In function 'rnbd_srv_get_full_path', inlined from 'process_msg_open.isra' at drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:721:14: drivers/block/rnbd/rnbd-srv.c:616:17: note: 'snprintf' output between 2 and 4351 bytes into a destination of size 4096 616 | snprintf(full_path, PATH_MAX, \"%s/%s\", | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 617 | dev_search_path, dev_name); | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To fix this, unconditionally check for truncation (as was already done for the case where \"%SESSNAME%\" was present).",
