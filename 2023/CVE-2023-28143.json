Attackers may exploit incorrect file permissions to give them ROOT command execution privileges on the host. During the install of the PKG, a step in the process involves extracting the package and copying files to several directories. Attackers may gain writable access to files during the install of PKG when extraction of the package and copying files to several directories, enabling a local escalation of privilege.",
