  "desc": "The Delete Me plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'plugin_delete_me' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 3.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The shortcode is not displayed to administrators, so it cannot be used against administrator users.",
