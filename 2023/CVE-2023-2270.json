  "desc": "The Netskope client service running with NT\\SYSTEM privileges accepts network connections from localhost to start various services and execute commands. The connection handling function of Netskope client before R100 in this service utilized a relative path to download and unzip configuration files on the machine. This relative path provided a way for local users to write arbitrary files at a location which is accessible to only higher privileged users. This can be exploited by local users to execute code with NT\\SYSTEM privileges on the end machine.",
