	"desc": "The Getwid â€“ Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to an insufficient capability check on the get_remote_templates function in versions up to, and including, 1.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to flush the remote template cache. Cached template information can also be accessed via this endpoint but these are not considered sensitive as they are publicly accessible from the developer's site.",
