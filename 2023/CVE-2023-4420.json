	"desc": "A remote unprivileged attacker can intercept the communication via e.g. Man-In-The-Middle, due to the absence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in the SICK LMS5xx. This lack of encryption in the communication channel can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. The attacker can exploit this weakness to eavesdrop on the communication between the LMS5xx and the Client, and potentially manipulate the data being transmitted.",
