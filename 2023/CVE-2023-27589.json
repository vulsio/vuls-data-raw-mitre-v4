  "desc": "Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Starting with RELEASE.2020-12-23T02-24-12Z and prior to RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z, a user with `consoleAdmin` permissions can potentially create a user that matches the root credential `accessKey`. Once this user is created successfully, the root credential ceases to work appropriately. The issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z. There are ways to work around this via adding higher privileges to the disabled root user via `mc admin policy set`.",
