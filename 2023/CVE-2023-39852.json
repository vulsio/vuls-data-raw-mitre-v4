NOTE: this is disputed by a third party who claims that the userid is a session variable controlled by the server, and thus cannot be used for exploitation. The original reporter counterclaims that this originates from $_SESSION[\"userid\"]=$_POST[\"userid\"] at line 68 in doctors\\doctorlogin.php, where userid under POST is not a session variable controlled by the server.",
