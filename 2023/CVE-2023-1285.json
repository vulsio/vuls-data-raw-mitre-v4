  "desc": "Signal Handler Race Condition vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric India GC-ENET-COM whose first 2 digits of 11-digit serial number of unit are \"16\" allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition in Ethernet communication by sending a large number of specially crafted packets to any UDP port when GC-ENET-COM is configured as a Modbus TCP Server. The communication resumes only when the power of the main unit is turned off and on or when the GC-ENET-COM is hot-swapped from the main unit.",
