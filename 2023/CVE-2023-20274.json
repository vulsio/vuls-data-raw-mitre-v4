	"desc": "A vulnerability in the installer script of Cisco AppDynamics PHP Agent could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient permissions that are set by the PHP Agent Installer on the PHP Agent install directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying objects in the PHP Agent install directory, which would run with the same privileges as PHP. A successful exploit could allow a lower-privileged attacker to elevate their privileges to root on an affected device.",
