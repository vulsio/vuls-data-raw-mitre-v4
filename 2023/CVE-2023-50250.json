	"desc": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. A reflection cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in version 1.2.25. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of other users. The vulnerability is found in `templates_import.php.` When uploading an xml template file, if the XML file does not pass the check, the server will give a JavaScript pop-up prompt, which contains unfiltered xml template file name, resulting in XSS. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute actions on behalf of other users. This ability to impersonate users could lead to unauthorized changes to settings. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.",
