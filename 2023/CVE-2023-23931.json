  "desc": "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.",
