  "desc": "It was found that the implementation of the GTNSubjectCreatingInterceptor class in gatein-wsrp was not thread safe. For a specific WSRP endpoint, under high-concurrency scenarios or scenarios where SOAP messages take long to execute, it was possible for an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain privileged information if WS-Security is enabled for the WSRP Consumer, and the endpoint in question is being used by a privileged user. This affects JBoss Portal 6.2.0.",
