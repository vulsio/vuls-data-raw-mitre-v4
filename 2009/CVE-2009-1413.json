  "desc": "Google Chrome 1.0.x does not cancel timeouts upon a page transition, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct Universal XSS attacks by calling setTimeout to trigger future execution of JavaScript code, and then modifying document.location to arrange for JavaScript execution in the context of an arbitrary web site.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for a remote attack by exploiting a chromehtml: argument-injection vulnerability.",
