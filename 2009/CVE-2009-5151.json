  "desc": "The stub component of Absolute Computrace Agent V70.785 executes code from a disk's inter-partition space without requiring a digital signature for that code, which allows attackers to execute code on the BIOS. This allows a privileged local user to achieve persistent control of BIOS behavior, independent of later disk changes.",
