  "desc": "In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, when the `boxes` argument of `tf.image.crop_and_resize` has a very large value, the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ `nan` floating point value. Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later produces a segmentation fault. The issue is patched in eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808 and TensorFlow 2.4.0 will be released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.",
