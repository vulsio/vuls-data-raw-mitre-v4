	"desc": "An issue was discovered in the yh_create_session() function of yubihsm-shell through 2.0.2. The function does not explicitly check the returned session id from the device. An invalid session id would lead to out-of-bounds read and write operations in the session array. This could be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service attack.",
