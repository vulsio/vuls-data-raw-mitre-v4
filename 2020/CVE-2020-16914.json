	"desc": "<p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface Plus (GDI+) handles objects in memory, allowing an attacker to retrieve information from a targeted system. By itself, the information disclosure does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability.</p> <p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how GDI+ handles memory addresses.</p>",
