The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted arguments to specific commands on the local management CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS with the privileges of the currently logged-in user for all affected platforms excluding Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects. On Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, the injected commands are executed with root privileges.",
