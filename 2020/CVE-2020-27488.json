  "desc": "Loxone Miniserver devices with firmware before 11.1 (aka 11.1.9.3) are unable to use an authentication method that is based on the \"signature of the update package.\" Therefore, these devices (or attackers who are spoofing these devices) can continue to use an unauthenticated cloud service for an indeterminate time period (possibly forever). Once an individual device's firmware is updated, and authentication occurs once, the cloud service recategorizes the device so that authentication is subsequently always required, and spoofing cannot occur.",
