This vulnerability could potentially allow users to share attached files such that they are accessible by anonymous users where they should be restricted to specific users.</p> <p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to attach a file as a link to an email. The email could then be shared with individuals that should not have access to the files, ignoring the default organizational setting.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Outlook handles file attachment links.</p>",
