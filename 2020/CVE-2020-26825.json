  "desc": "SAP Fiori Launchpad (News tile Application), versions - 750,751,752,753,754,755, allows an unauthorized attacker to use SAP Fiori Launchpad News tile Application to send malicious code, to a different end user (victim), because News tile does not sufficiently encode user controlled inputs, resulting in Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Information maintained in the victim's web browser can be read, modified, and sent to the attacker. The malicious code cannot significantly impact the victim's browser and the victim can easily close the browser tab to terminate it.",
