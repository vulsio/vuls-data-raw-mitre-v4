  "desc": "Slack Nebula through 1.1.0 contains a relative path vulnerability that allows a low-privileged attacker to execute code in the context of the root user via tun_darwin.go or tun_windows.go. A user can also use Nebula to execute arbitrary code in the user's own context, e.g., for user-level persistence or to bypass security controls. NOTE: the vendor states that this \"requires a high degree of access and other preconditions that are tough to achieve.\"",
