	"desc": "In affected versions of TensorFlow the tf.raw_ops.DataFormatVecPermute API does not validate the src_format and dst_format attributes. The code assumes that these two arguments define a permutation of NHWC. This can result in uninitialized memory accesses, read outside of bounds and even crashes. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.",
