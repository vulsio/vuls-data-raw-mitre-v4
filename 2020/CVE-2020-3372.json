The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of crafted HTTP requests to the affected web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the system to stop processing new connections and could result in a DoS condition.",
