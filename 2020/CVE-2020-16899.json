An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a target system to stop responding.</p> <p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send specially crafted ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets to a remote Windows computer. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly.</p> <p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows TCP/IP stack handles ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets.</p>",
