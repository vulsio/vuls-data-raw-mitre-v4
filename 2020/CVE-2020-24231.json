  "desc": "Symmetric DS <3.12.0 uses mx4j to provide access to JMX over HTTP. mx4j, by default, has no auth and is available on all interfaces. An attacker can interact with JMX: get system info, and invoke MBean methods. It is possible to install additional MBeans from a remote host using MLet that leads to arbitrary code execution.",
