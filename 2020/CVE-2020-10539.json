The Epikur server contains the checkPasswort() function that, upon user login, checks the submitted password against the user password's MD5 hash stored in the database. It is also compared to a second MD5 hash, which is the same for every user (aka a \"Backdoor Password\" of 3p1kursupport). If the submitted password matches either one, access is granted.",
