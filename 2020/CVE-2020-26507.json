By providing formula code in the “Notes” functionality in the main screen, an attacker can inject a payload into the “Description” field under the “Insert To-Do” option. Other users might download this data, for example a CSV file, and execute the malicious commands on their computer by opening the file using a software such as Microsoft Excel. The attacker could gain remote access to the user’s PC.",
