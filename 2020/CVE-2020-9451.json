  "desc": "An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510. anti_ransomware_service.exe keeps a log in a folder where unprivileged users have write permissions. The logs are generated in a predictable pattern, allowing an unprivileged user to create a hardlink from a (not yet created) log file to anti_ransomware_service.exe. On reboot, this forces the anti_ransomware_service to try to write its log into its own process, crashing in a SHARING VIOLATION. This crash occurs on every reboot.",
