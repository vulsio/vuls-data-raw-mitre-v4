	"desc": "<p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in how splwow64.exe handles certain calls. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the userâ€™s system (low-integrity to medium-integrity).</p> <p>This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability (such as a remote code execution vulnerability or another elevation of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution is attempted.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring splwow64.exe properly handles these calls.</p>",
