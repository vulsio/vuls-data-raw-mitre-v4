The key is in com/mobileiron/registration/RegisterActivity.java and can be used for api/v1/gateway/customers/servers requests. NOTE: Vendor states that this is an opt-in feature to the product - it is not enabled by default and customers cannot enable it without an explicit email to support. At this time, they do not plan change to make any changes to this feature.",
